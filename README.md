# Hair-Project
The purpose of my project was to create a model that recognizes the hair type of the person based on a picture.

In order to do that, I programmed a CNN and I preprocessed pictures with VGG16 preprocessing.
For this project, I used the "Three Hair Types" dataset that I found on Kaggle which contains a thousands of images for three different hair types: straight hair, curly hair and wavy hair. The creator of this dataset is vyom bhatia and he precised: "I scrapped all these images from google images using a chrome extension and sorted them out, image by image. I feel bad because I cannot give credit to the owners and Data Ethics is something I have to improve in as a person."
Here is the link of the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vyombhatia/the-three-hair-types/data

You will find the code that I used attached to this repository
